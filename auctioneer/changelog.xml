				Khaos support has been added!! I know it is not pretty (I myself don't like the implementation very much) but it works so far. To the end user the experience will be mostly seamless. I am still working on a Auctioneer-to-Khaos update mechanism, but that will be with the much needed implementation revamp.
			</developer>
			<public>
				Khaos support has been added! All of the options that you can set via the /auctioneer commands has been integrated into a Khaos-based GUI. Enjoy!

				<change function="Auctioneer_AuctionEntry_Hook" />
			</file>
			<developer>
				Because the identifier created to provide auctioneer to add duplicated scans was not unique in all cases, some indexes on specified pages, were never added to the database.
				I.e. page 11-14, 21-24, 31-34... item 1-9 were never scanned. That was caused by the identifier being the same as the one used for page 1,2,3,... item 11-49.
				Also changed the identifier to no longer use the categoryname. Instead it now uses the corresponding categorynumber, too.
			</developer>
			<public>
				Fixed a bug that resulted in some items having been overleapt while scanning the AH.

				<change function="Auctioneer_GetHighestSellablePriceForOne" />
			</file>
			<developer>
				The parametervalidation was bugged. Instead of only checking for nil values, it also checked if useCachedPrices was true, so the function always returned nil, if it shouldn't work with CachedPrices.
				Also changed the code to only call auctionKey() once.

				<change function="Auctioneer_NewTooltip" />
			</file>
			<developer>
				Removed the data reference from the function, as that global no longer exists and the value was only used to calculate the sell/buy prices for items with an itemID <= 0.
				For those items there is currently no sell/buy value calculated (as I have no idea, what an itemId <= 0 could mean)
				Also removed the now useless local money variable and replaced the initialization of sell/buy.

				fixed the "attempt to index global `data' (a string value)" bug

				Major typo fixed in that function. Instead of xxxxx_ProcessLinks, xxxxx_ProcessLink was tried to call which never existed and therefore the integration into IM/LL never worked.
				Also changed the parameters to match the latest versions of both addons.

				BID_BASED_CATEGORIES used the english category-names as it's keyvalue and compared it to the strings returned by GetAuctionItemClasses. That only worked fine for the English client. For others (like the German/French client) the comparisons always returned false, even if they should be true, as the GetAuctionItemClasses returns the localized strings (Armor = R&uuml;stung, Weapon = Waffen, etc.).
				A converter has also been added which is called once when the VARIABLES LOADED event is raised to convert old categorydata to the new format. This converter can easily be adjusted to new datachanges and takes very little time if the data has already been converted.
				All corresponding calls have been changed. The stringvalue still used for auctionDoneKey in GetAuctionItemClasses.
				The prototype of Auctioneer_AuctionEntry_Hook has also be changed. The last value should now be the integer representative of the category (was the string value).
				Also did some tiny code optimizations in some of the abovementioned functions.
			</developer>
			<public>
				If you used another clientversion than the english one, auctioneer didn't always use bidbased prices, when it should have.
				As a sideeffect, that bugfix also reduced the memoryusage a bit.

				removed the code which calculates the marketprice from getHighestSellablePriceForOne and added it to a seperate function: getMarketPrice
				added the realm-parameter to getHighestSellablePriceForOne, which is used by getMarketPrice and needed for Auctioneer_NewTooltip (suggested price for alternative realms)
				replaced the calculations of the suggested prices in Auctioneer_NewTooltip by the calculation done in Auctioneer_OnEvent
				Changed the tooltipoutput for suggested prices and removed the bid-value (it doesn't make any sense here)
			</developer>
			<public>
				The suggested price shown in the tooltip differed from the one which was displayed when putting a new item in the AH.
				Also removed the (xxx bidded) text in the suggested price-line, as it had no purpose at all.
