	This is an addon for World of Warcraft that adds statistical history to the auction data that is collected
	when the auction is scanned, so that you can easily determine what price
	you will be able to sell an item for at auction or at a vendor whenever you
	mouse-over an item in the game

	Install BonusID data to the core AucAdvanced.Data table

	Implemented as a separate file containg raw bonusID data, for ease of maintenance
	Auctioneer modules will normally compile the raw data into a more useable format, usually during "gameactive" event

	This is not a complete set of all BonusIDs, only a subset that may be of interest to Auctioneer
