[Enchantrix]
#desc	For the enchanter who just wants the basic disenchant and barking functionality, contains just {{Enchantrix}} and {{Enchantrix-Barker}}. {{Enchantrix}} is an addon which predicts disenchant results based off accumulated disenchant data. It does come with it's own database, so right out of the box, it's pretty good at estimating the actual probability of disenchant results. {{Enchantrix-Barker}} is a product which will let you broadcast your disenchants on the trade channel with ease. {{Enchantrix}} can combine with {{BottomScanner}} to provide additional buying for disenchant opportunities.

[BottomScanner]
#desc	This {{BottomScanner}} standalone package is useful if you want to use {{BottomScanner}} with something other than {{AuctioneerClassic}} or {{AuctioneerAdvanced}} for it's pricing data, if you want to add it to {{Enchantrix}} or just use it stand-alone. {{BottomScanner}} allows searching and analysis of the auction contents for specific good buys. When it identifies something that is a "good buy" according to the rules you set, it will alert you and give you the choice to buy or bid on the item.
