There is no support to import your old settings in alpha or beta releases. Back up your old data first by moving it out of the saved variable directory (preferably right out of the WoW tree). %gamedir%\WTF\Acount\%accountname%\SavedVariables\[eE]nchantrix.lua*

Do this because we cannot guarantee that the SV format for any alpha or beta will be permanently set in stone.

If you don't understand this, you probably shouldn't be using alpha or beta mods.

There are known current issues, but this doesn't mean we're hard at work fixing them right at this moment. We could well be working hard on the backend rather than concentrating on UI fluff ;)

Known current issues for 3.9.xxxx:

. /enchantrix percentless <value> may not work correctly.

No doubt there are more known and recorded elsewhere, others known and not recorded, thos not known, heisenbugs and others.

If you're going to report a bug to us on our alpha/beta builds, please ensure you're using the latest development version from http://auctioneeraddon.com/dl Occasional IRC support on irc://irc.freenode.net/norganna
